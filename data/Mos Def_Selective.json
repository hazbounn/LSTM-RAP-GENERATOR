And that's fine; we don't have to be enemies and we don't have to be friends either. My family and I are prepared, immediately, to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state, never to return to this state again. We don't have to be here. We're not pining to be here, and we\u2019re complying in every possible way, reasonably. Just today, state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family, and they had no right to do so. I have legal representation here who they could easily contact. They're contravening and breaking all types of international law, and it's untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on. And I know it's been a lot of chatter about what's going on, you know, people are running to the press, because that's just\u2026you know, a money making machine. So, it\u2019s another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera, some tele-novella, and I have no interest in it. Furthermore, related but not directly related to this: I'm retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today, and also from Hollywood, effective immediately. I am releasing my final album this year. Um\u2026and that's that\n\nPeace to all, fear of none. Thank everyone for their time. Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite, as Nas said. And I'm on the side of the right, so people could wish however they want, but I ain't nobody's\u2026I ain't no threat or a hazard to nobody. I really try to mind my business. What people think about me is none of my business, and I'm not here to change people's opinions about me. You don't have to like me; you don't have to like everything that I say. The fact is, is that I have hurt no one. I have injured no parties, and all I require, as is my lawful right, is innocent passage to my domicile. That is all\n\nIn summary, I will say this, I will close with a simple prayer: To the one who has created the all, you know me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than people know me. So, forgive me for whatever they know or do not know. Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said. Ameen, ameen, allahumma ameen\n\nAnd I'll close for you, Ye, with the, with the verse that I kicked for you on December 31st, when you was in Atlantic City and you announced that you and Kim were having Nori. And, and, shout out to Madlib, and Otis, and\u2026and\u2026and Michael and his entire family, and to Mama Jackson and to the whole Jackson clan in L.A., I wish you and your family the best, your mother, you know, reach out to me, Egon, you know, y'all know how to reach. Shout out to Corey Smyth, shout out to my brother Talib Kweli, salaam to my brother Kamaal Fareed, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Islam, all of the Zulu Nation. The Zulu Nation real here; there's real Zulus. My brother, Siyabonga, the Madlalas. All of the people here who have supported me: this is no reflection on you. I love the people of this country. I love this continent. I do not have to sit idly by and just be persecuted unfairly by a state. They waste enough of my time and... I'm through with you Felicia... we're through. I don't want nothing from you. You can keep the records, the sweatshirts, everything; it's no problem. But I'll end with this verse that I wanna put on \"No More Parties in LA,\" if you would kindly allow me, my dear brother Kanye. And shout out to K. Lamar, too; I see you, my dude\nLonely America, crazy America\nLoud ass, country ass, cocaine America\nLethal America, carcinogen, asthma\nCarbonated smoke throughout your blood plasma\nLights and camera, action, surveillance\nHelicopters, teleprompters\nFlossy newscasters, rich, fool, bastards\nWar, migrant workers, cold murder, traffic\nWelcome to Los... stop right there\nBiggie got shot right here\nAngeles\nHollywood, hoes, handguns\n\nPeace to all, fear none.

think of home, my remembrance of my beginning\nLaundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen\nChillin in front my building with my brother and them\nSpending nights in Bushwick with my cousins and them\nWise town and Beat Street, federal relief\nSlowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat\nSticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep\nWith every flavor Now & Later only a dime apiece\nOld timers on the bench playing cards and thangs\nTelling tales about they used to be involved in things\nStart to drinking, talking loud, cussing up and showing out\nOn the phone, call the cops, pick'em up, move'em out\nAnd it's all too common to start wildin\nI'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence\nAnd it's hard to find\nBlock parties in dark lobbies\nFuneral homes packed but only dark bodies\nI can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley\nMarley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall\nSon I been to many places in my space and time\nAnd whatever my home is, son home is mine\n\n", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e6832cab470314ffb530b255928573d.600x600x1.jpg"}, {"title": "Hip Hop", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "My restlessness is my

to basements\nArrangement basic, but still fans chase it\nY2K can't delete the true ancient\nApache war drum on the ranges\nSkill level dangerous\nArrow head that killed all the cavemen\nThey cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement\nAnd get violated like a plaintiff\nI ain't shit to play with\nI give a Goddamn what your name is\nDelete it and make it so it never get repeated\nBelieve
