in my face?\nWhy they raiding my place?\nWhy I don't feel safe?\nThis is not an expression of fear\nThis is just to make things clear\nMy intentions are pure in coming here\nAnd that's for everything I love or hold dear\nUmi's in the building\nSo is my wife and my children\nI committed no crime\nWhy is the state wasting my time?\nThey must be out of their minds\nI forgive 'em, that's the spirit of divine\nI just wanna go where I'm wanted\nWhere I'm loved, stop frontin'\nWhere I live is my choice, you cannot mute my voice\nThank you, Kanye West, for being a real friend, a real friend\nA real friend\n\nI heard your choice the first time, I'll go away\nAnd when I leave, that's exactly where I'll stay\nThis is not an expression of fear\nThis is just to make things clear\nA country called Earth, everywhere\nA country called Earth, everywhere\n\nThe state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily. And that's fine; we don't have to be enemies and we don't have to be friends either. My family and I are prepared, immediately, to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state, never to return to this state again. We don't have to be here. We're not pining to be here, and we\u2019re complying in every possible way, reasonably. Just today, state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family, and they had no right to do so. I have legal representation here who they could easily contact. They're contravening and breaking all types of international law, and it's untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on. And I know it's been a lot of chatter about what's going on, you know, people are running to the press, because that's just\u2026you know, a money making machine. So, it\u2019s another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera, some tele-novella, and I have no interest in it. Furthermore, related but not directly related to this: I'm retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today, and also from Hollywood, effective immediately. I am releasing my final album this year. Um\u2026and that's that\n\nPeace to all, fear of none. Thank everyone for their time. Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite, as Nas said. And I'm on the side of the right, so people could wish however they want, but I ain't nobody's\u2026I ain't no threat or a hazard to nobody. I really try to mind my business. What people think about me is none of my business, and I'm not here to change people's opinions about me. You don't have to like me; you don't have to like everything that I say. The fact is, is that I have hurt no one. I have injured no parties, and all I require, as is my lawful right, is innocent passage to my domicile. That is all\n\nIn summary, I will say this, I will close with a simple prayer: To the one who has created the all, you know me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than people know me. So, forgive me for whatever they know or do not know. Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said. Ameen, ameen, allahumma ameen\n\nAnd I'll close for you, Ye, with the, with the verse that I kicked for you on December 31st, when you was in Atlantic City and you announced that you and Kim were having Nori. And, and, shout out to Madlib, and Otis, and\u2026and\u2026and Michael and his entire family, and to Mama Jackson and to the whole Jackson clan in L.A., I wish you and your family the best, your mother, you know, reach out to me, Egon, you know, y'all know how to reach. Shout out to Corey Smyth, shout out to my brother Talib Kweli, salaam to my brother Kamaal Fareed, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Islam, all of the Zulu Nation. The Zulu Nation real here; there's real Zulus. My brother, Siyabonga, the Madlalas. All of the people here who have supported me: this is no reflection on you. I love the people of this country. I love this continent. I do not have to sit idly by and just be persecuted unfairly by a state. They waste enough of my time and... I'm through with you Felicia... we're through. I don't want nothing from you. You can keep the records, the sweatshirts, everything; it's no problem. But I'll end with this verse that I wanna put on \"No More Parties in LA,\" if you would kindly allow me, my dear brother Kanye. And shout out to K.

He was unarmed and shot at 41 times! No unarmed man should be shot at even once! One of the police officers involved in the Diallo shooting was involved in the killing of Patrick Bailey no more than a year and a half ago! Tyesha Miller was shot in her car in Los Angeles while she had a seizure! I could go on and on with the names of black people who have been killed at the hands of police just this year. But the list is so long that it would turn this letter into a statistic sheet.\n\nMost of the people that got killed by police this year and in the past have probably been some of your fans; fans of some of your favorite artists. They are black people who love us, who defend us, who protect us, who put us in our comfortable homes an dour luxury sports utility vehicles and our well kept hotels suites and our oversized tour buses. They're the people that buy our records, our t-shirts, our concert tickets, and so on, and so forth. They're the same people that are getting murdered, harassed, maimed, and beaten in streets all over the world everyday!\n\nThe only people in our community who have not responded to this incident are us. Hip-Hop made one hundred billion dollars last year!... A lot of those dollars came from the 'Comptoms', the 'Brooklyns', the 'Crown Heights', the 'Chicagos', the Detroit ghettos, the St. Louis ghettos... the same ghettos where police run around literally hunting black folks to murder... then cruise the streets shortly thereafter with impunity and arrogance.\n\nWe are the Senators and the Congressmen of our communities. We come from communities that don't have nobody to speak for them. That's why they love us. Because we talk about what nobody else will talk about. We represent them. And they need to know that we really represent them. Not when it's just a romantic notion or a paycheck attached to it. When something happens to them it matters to us, because when something happens to them it's happening to us. Because Amadou Diallo is your brother, your cousin, your man... Tyesha Miller is your sister, your aunt, your girl, your wife, your daughter... All of these people are you! You are no different! And just because we're at the top of the Billboard charts, seen on MTV daily, livin' comfortably doesn't mean that we can't get shot, we can't be harassed, we can't be maimed and mistreated.\n\nI hope this is as important to you as it is to me cause when I pass by the projects and when I pass by the hood I don't see nobody but me. I see everybody who looks like me. I see me many years ago as I'm sure many of you do. So it's time for us to come together from the 'jiggy' to the 'hardcore'; from the 'backpacker' to the man with the Lexus and really unite and show the world that we got strength. Show the world who we are. Represent who we are. Who we really are and where we really come from. Let's show people where our heart is... that we haven't forgotten.\n\nNow I'm askin' you and anybody who looks on this letter to come forward and show your heart, to show your love, to love the people who love you back by speaking out against the injustices that they suffer. Because believe me, if the clock was turned backwards we'd be those same people.\n\nPlease stay mindful of this. Please be considerate of this letter. Pass it around! Talk about this! Think about it! Keep it on your mind because if you don't... it's going to keep its mind on you.\n\nI wanna thank everybody for taking time out to read this letter. I hope I didn't take up too much of your time. All of the contact information and other information you need to know is enclosed.\n\nI want to wish everybody, each and everyone of ya'll peace, prosperity and love.\n\nPeace,\nMos Def", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/66d90efb0e8b4240aae30047ecbc672b.300x319x1.jpg"}, {"title": "Auditorium", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "The way I feel, sometimes it's too hard to sit still\nThings are so passionate, times are so real\nSometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke\nSmile on my face but it's really no joke\nYou feel it in the street, the people breathe without hope\nThey goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down the focus\nThe focus get cleared then the light turn sharp\nAnd the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary\nI speak it so clearly sometimes y'all don't hear me\nI push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me\nI feel it in my bones, black I'm so wide awake\nThat I hardly ever sleep, my flow forever deep\nAnd it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on a beat\nMy presence speak volumes before I say a word\nI'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement and curb\nCradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell\nUniversal ghetto life, holla black you know it well\nQuiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across\nMind is a vital force, high level right across\nSoul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren\nI swing round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant\nShocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided\nThe world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'\nSuckas trying to hide like the struggle won't find 'em\nThen the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him\nEverywhere penthouse pavement and curb\nCradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell\nUniversal ghetto life, holla black you know it well\n\n", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b13acc0fe75405f9fde88d9e60c03a7a.640x640x1.jpg"}, {"title": "Auditorium w/ the Ruler", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Yo\nThe way I feel sometimes it's too hard to sit still\nThings are so passionate, times are so real\nSometimes I try an chill mellow down blowin' smoke\nSmile on my face but it's really no joke\n\nYou feel it in the streets, the people breathe without hope\nThey goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down, they focus\nThe focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp\nAnd the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary\n\nI speak it so clearly, sometimes ya don't hear me\nI push it past the bass, no nations gotta feel me\nI feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake\nThat I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep\nAnd it's volumes or scriptures when I breath on a beat\n\nMy presence speak volumes before I say a word\nI'm everywhere, penthouse, pavement and curb\nCradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell\nUniversal ghetto life holla black, you know it well\n\nQuiet storm, vital form pen pushed it right across\nMind is a vital force, high level right across\nShoulders the lions raw voice is the siren\nI swing round, ring out and bring down the tyrant\n\nShocked, a small act could knock a giant lopsided\nThe world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'\nSuttins tryna hide like the struggle won't find 'em\nAnd the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him\n\nEverywhere, penthouse, pavement and curb\nCradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell\nUniversal ghetto life holla black, you know it well\n\nWhat it is?

projects\nListen\n\nI stepped on the field from no league, just home team\nI Jumped out the stands and I snatched the rock\nWith the final seconds one, two, land on the clock\nMos post up to throw up the tie-breakin' shot\nI put it through the net and let the world's jaw drop\nThen fled the arena before they called cops\nTell the players and the coach I wasn't tryin to blow spot\nBut the way they was ballin' made it difficult to watch\nI was taught when there's somethin' you can change around\nKeep quiet, you got nothin' to complain about\nYou got work to do, I don't know if that work for you\nBut thats how Mos work it through\nAnd my work is personal, I'm a workin person\nI put in work, I work with purpose\nI get it there, on the water, air, the surface\nYou feel the impact, niggas yeah it's workin\nListen God did not make me a fearful person\nThe only fear I have, Is my failure to adhear his path\nI would love it just to hear this back\nOn the ghetto streets where y'all at\nOn the ave's where the Jeep's go past\nIn the coupes where the seats go back\nIn the parties where it be so packed\nAnd the atmosphere be so black\nAnd them black things be so phat\nIf I could I would be so glad\nBut if not I won't be so mad\nI'm still being a man, still feeding my fam\nAnd even if you don't see it my fam\nI believe that I am, truly gifted, truly blessed\nI'm yours truly, Brooklyn's own, Mos Def\nI'm rockin the hard right, ground zero, to far left\nI'm, well balanced, with immense talents\nBurn the script, then flip it to keep myself challanged\nAnd thats the mark of a true

world from the wives of MCs\nThese cats is paying more than half a pound\nMy garment bag'll snatch it down\nAin't got the skate, but we can probably run it back in town\nScenarios like this is tear jerkers\nFor the modern emcee, ie. the blue collar worker\nCause this thing called rhyming, no different from coal mining\nWe both on assignment, to unearth the diamond\nWhile you start climbing in 'em, I start shining\nYou be struggling and striving\nAnd they think you prime timing\nMaintain and keep silent\nMake note and observation\nThis confrontation\nThis is the daily operation\nMy concentration\nStay focused on my recitation\nBout to reach my destination\nWith no pause or hesitation\nBaby make the preparation\nCause this ain't no recreation\nThis is pro-ball\nAnd we lettin' you know y'all\nAt the show y'all\nDoing this for dough y'all\nGet the phone call\nAnd I'm ready to blow y'all\nBout to go y'all\nBeen a pleasure to know y'all\nAnd I'm lettin' you know that\n\nBut God willing I'll be back home\nTo drop these heavy ass bags up off my back bone\nAround the world with a catalogue of rap songs\nMy baby girl is walking, been away for that long\nBut no you haven't well at least that's how it seem to me\nMy hometown is like a whole different scenery\nThe old timers on the stoop leaning leisurely\nThe new jacks up in the parks smoking greenery\nEasily take it for granted when you up in it\nBut it's sweet scented, when you been down for a minute\nMove around city limits, break 'em down with the vinitage\nThe inovinin', classical b-boy image\nCollect the winnings\nCause it the reason that we came here\nThis thing is not a game here\nThe fortune not the fame here\nFrom New York to the Cackalacks\nCali and the Cadillacs\nChicago no we innovate\nInfiltrate Virginia state\nDC make me stimulate\nPhilly know we penetrate\nGeorgia make us generate\nLet's set a date to get the papes\nThey celebrate to my jams in foreign lands\nEven your mans in Japan know who I am\nMina-san, make everybody out in Nippon\nSay ichiban, me God man bo where you hitting from\nPhenomenon\nScuse me that's a phone call\nIt's a show y'all\nTrying to get this

lounge about to levitate\nYou don't believe let me demonstrate\nThe way we make cats disintegrate\n\n(Cosmo)\nWell hold up you got to stop the tape\nYou got to prove you can rock the break\nMe and my man going to investigate\nThe whole way that you operate, cooperate\nAnd what's your name? {Mos Def}\nAnd where you from? {Brooklyn}\nAnd how you living {Very well, very well}\nDamn you had to say it twice? {That's right}\nSo you nice? {Damn right}\n\n(Mos Def)\nI rock the party all night all night\n{All right, all right}\nSo why you over here riffing with me?\nTrying to prove your position to me?\n{Some cats ain't equipped to MC}\nBut you can see I'm different 'G'\nThe universal magnificently\nI rock the party efficiently\nFrom the Brooklyn vicinit-y\nAnd I do it so lyrically\nThat you got to give it to me\nLike Rick James, I kick game and spit flames\nBurning rappers all up out their frame\nWe get into this vein\nFrom Brownsville all the way down to Brisbane\n{Damn this brother's flow is insane}\nThat's what I've been trying to explain\nGot no time to play games\nKeep it coming like the next train\nMake the party people exclaim\nWhenever they hear my name\nThey go 'Mos Def'\nOh yes my style is so fresh\nGuaranteed to win any MC contest\nOld school like the '84 fresh fest\nYou spend your assets to get my cassette\nNow that's fresh, the red hook address\nMake the comp jeal and swell like abscess\nI'm shoutin' big love to Medina and the rest\nBout' to drop it on your block the hot on the press\n\n(Chorus with singing in background)\nI said people in the front jam on it {Say what, say what}\nTo all my people in the back jam on it {Say what, say what}\nTo all my people on the side jam on it {Ha ha, ha ha}\nJam on it, Ha ha, ha ha\n\nTo all my people in the front jam on it\nTo all my people in the back jam on it\nTo all my people on the side jam on it\nSo jam on it, ha ha, ha ha\n\n(Mos Def)\nYou see my name is Mos Def and my style will never pest\nBrown skinned body-rocking MC\nI got the black zodiac and you know it's never whack\nSagitarius definatley\nYou see it's me and lyricist and we're getting serious about to\nMake another hit\nI tell your homeboy chill cuz' his style ain't ill but it's\nStraight up counterfeit\nYou see I'm faster then a speeding bullet and when I'm on\nThe set\nAll the hip-hop fans just raise they hands 'cause I'm the one and\nOnly mighty Mos Def\nYou see I come into the party in a 'B-Boy' stance I rock the mic\nSo viciously\nSo all the real 'B-boys' and real 'B-Girls' know it's no other\nBetter than me\n\n(Cosmo)\nI said hey Mos Def you can't steal the show\nYou ain't the only MC out here with flow\nI'm the Pro Cosmo and I'm letting you know\nThat I get on the mic and go toe to toe\n\n(Mos Def)\nWell cool down young brother just slow your roll\nCuz' your arm's to shook to have mic control\nSee I get on the mic and jump on your case\nYou best get out my face and stay in a child's place\n\n(Cosmo)\nSee I get on the mic because I know I can\nAnd I'm fresher than you because I know I am\nSo when I jump on the stage you better step back\n'Cause your name is Mos Def but your really Mos Whack\n\n(Mos Def)\nUh listen up little brother you ain't grown\nThe sun is going down you need to take your butt home\nYou come outside with your whack freestylin'\nShould have kept it 'In the House' like Debbie Allen\nWhen I grab the microphone people scream my name\nThe ain't no Sesame Street this is a grown-man's lane\nSee you best heed my words and listen up\nOr I'm a tell your momma to whip your butt\n\n(Cosmo)\nWell you ain't my daddy and I'm letting you know\nThat you can't tell me when it's time to go\nSee I get on the mic and show you what it's about\nCuz' even my momma said knock you out\n\n(Mos Def)\nWell if you didn't know baby boy I'm a tell ya'\nYou need to learn to respect your elders\nBut since you here and you think you got skill\nThen get on the mic and show your real\n\n(Cosmo)\nWell I'm the devastatin' never fakin'\nAlways keep the party shakin'\nSteady rockin' never stoppin'\nKeep the party people jockin'\nRock the beat, shock the beat\nTill' it's time to

Funk Crush\nYoung blood just hungry\nIt's no glamour, it's no glory\nIt's no joke no game\nIt's murder everyday, murder (Boogeyman)\n\n(They shot the boy!)\nThe murder of a teenage life\nFire from the cold steel, the heat from the brights\nThe temperature of flesh and the shortness of breath\nThe murder of a teenage threat\nThe aroma of sinsemilia dollar superstar\nScum of vicodin cocaine tobacco leaf\nEcstatic tap-less fire water and freaky-deeky-e\nThe murder of a teenage chief\nMy easy speaking is easy as it seem to be\nHungry belly drama busts off easily\nBalloon bang, pop, hot as a bang spot in Bangkok\nColder than a pimp Glock, aim shot the frame drops\nPressure pushed him to the earth like a rain drop\nTake not life in vain, now how the preacher was saying\nRemember anyway they laid him in the straight box\nDark suit and gray socks the neighborhood is all distraught\nCandle lights upon the news report the families and students saw\nConfused in awe, they weep into each others' arms\nIt's murder\nNew absence from a mother's arm\nEven the warmth from the mother's arms\nCould not keep her son from harm\nFrom standing where the gun was drawn\nOver come done and done he gone, murder\nShell like a bell that rung\nThe blood burst body temperature fell and plunged\nAnd then the time it took the medics to come\nThe breath eased out of his lungs\nAnd his soul eased out of the slums\nAnd the voice eased out of the drums\nThe sireens they gleam they swung, murder\nTelephone wire sneakers hung, murder\nFor the black and young, murder, and the Ave they from\nI am from the block the president did not campaign on\nWhere the dollar that the working poor slave for is made on\nWhere hustlers stretch the yay long\nHustle hard for an outpost to trade on\nFlip it over and make more\nWhere the blocks are yellow taped off\nYoung bloods is trained off for obese to gray zone\nWhere the pressure just stay on\nBut the lights and the heat don't\nThe place where you witness the true power of street folk\nAnd that's where I'm coming from people\nHigh post low key eighth oz and kilo\nLaw man dope man adversary amigo\nPreacher man pimp hand both folding their C-notes\nA black fist clutching deliverance for the people\nYoung hand reach out, strong hand reach in\nChop the devil's hand to make the fucker stop reaching\nGhetto people know when the voice of true speaking\nM-Def, and foreal hold still nigga seein'\nI ain't got to say please, just believe it\nThe unerasable the black ink fact\nY'all fuckers know exactly how to act get back\nForever black

strain we been through\nBut it's of no consequence cause I'm comin through\n\nCheck it\nI first stood ???? in the ??Brakalak??\nIn the center of ??Islam??, started ????\nThis had to be about ten years back\nBefore I ever even heard of a 24 track\nTalkin about you was an MC was ??quite the?? move\nCause if you said you had skill well then you had to\nShow and prove\nAnd if there ever was a party, son, yo, I would set it\nAnd tell the deejay run the beat from (Ultra-magnetic)\nI grabbed the mic and then I leave the party buzzin\nTellin all my honeys I was Slick Rick's cousin\nWhen they knew I wasn't, but I had no shame\nPa, you know the name, the Mos always had game\nBack in the day ?????\nBrothers knew how to act before Glocks and crack\nAnd Wendy C was doin radio shows\nAnd 'crossover' meant that you wore your mom's clothes\nWhen Sweet G was talkin about the games that people\nPlay\nI used to sit back and say: yeah indeed, someday\nAnd as I grew older my kung fu grew better\nInstead of shootin the humbles I was shootin ????\nAnd now my time has come\nAnd now hip-hop's an industry polluted by bums\nPosin with guns they're puffin mad blunts\nAiyo, brothers just started rhymin last month\nThey gettin fat deals on any major label\nWhen they only see other people hold the mic cable\nFive years ago when peoples danced to house\nWhen the deejay played hip-hop then you walked out\nBut now you're hard, talkin about you paid mad dues\nI used to see your ass ???? wearin platform shoes\nI ain't confused, who you think you're foolin with that\n????\nYou ain't genuine, so don't

the casket, the hurt, i couldn't mask it\nMixin down emotions, struggle i hadn't mastered\nI coreograph seven steps to heaven\nAnd hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leavened\nVeteran of a cold war it's chica-i-go for\nWhat i know or, what's known\nSo some days i take the bus home, just to touch home\nFrom the crib i spend months gone\nSat by the window with a clutched dome listenin to shorties cuss long\nYoung girls with weak minds, but they butt strong\nTried to call, or at least beep the lord, but didn't have a touch-tone\nIt's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on\nSome of this land i must own\nOutta the city, they want us gone\nTearin down the 'jects creatin plush homes\nMy circumstance is between cabrini and love jones\nSurrounded by hate, yet i love home\nAsk my god how he thought travellin the world sound\nFound it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown\nIt's deep, i heard the city breathe in its sleep\nOf reality i touch, but for me it's hard to keep\nDeep, i heard my man breathe in his sleep\nOf reality i touch, but for me it's hard to keep\nSo much on my mind i just can't recline\nBlastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine\nBreathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine\nBreathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline\nYo how the bass ride out like an ancient mating call\nI can't take it y'all, i can feel the city breathing\nChest heavin, against the flesh of the evening\nKiss the ide's goodbye, i'm on the last train leaving", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4d1a9757d430776710118a3e0ba4658f.1000x667x1.jpg"}, {"title":
