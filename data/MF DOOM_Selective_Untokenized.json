He was part of the group KMD with his younger brother (DJ Subroc)  and third member Rodan, who was later replaced by Onyx the Birthstone Kid. After his brother DJ Subroc's death and the group was dropped from their label, DOOM went off the grid for half a decade.<endline><endline>During his time with KMD DOOM didn't wear anything to hide his face from the public.

This was made shortly after Operation: Doomsday as he was seen wearing this during his performances at this point in time.<endline><endline>This mask, which is basically just the face plate from a dissmantled roman helmet replica from the movie 'Gladiator' enriched with construction helmet webbing, is considered to be the face of MF DOOM ever since.<endline>Original DOOM mask + Side spikes (2005 ~ 2010)Started to appear around the time DOOM collaborated with Danger Mouse as DANGERDOOM.<endline><endline>In 2004 DOOM was still seen with his original mask; for instance on the cover of 'Madvillainy'. 2005 was the year his album 'The Mouse and the Mask' came out. Even though the mask illustrated on the cover of this album doesn't have any side spikes, there are in fact pictures of the duo DANGERDOOM with these on the side of his face.<endline><endline>The overal aesthetics of the mask are identical to the original mask; only there are now two spikes located on each temperol bone.<endline>Original DOOM mask + Jewel & Side spikes (2011 ~ 2014)Can be seen in the music videos for his collaboration with Jneiro Jarel, where he appears as part of JJ DOOM. Also worn during the RedBull Music academy interview which took place in Madrid, 2011.<endline><endline>It basically is identical to the original mask with the side spikes, The biggest change however is that this mask has a small mostly red jewel in between the eyebrow area. On some occassions the jewel was seen in other colors, for instance cyan blue. It also looks more chrome-ish since the mask reflects more light than the others normally did.<endline>Golden DOOM mask (May 2014)First appeared in an announcement video DOOM made for 'Check the Rhyme' festival in France where he had a show.<endline><endline>This mask was the first iteration which changed the primary color of it, being gold instead of metallic/silver. Another unique detail about this mask is that appart from the earlier described masks there is a color difference in the hardware; The side spikes are still the chrome/silverish color while the rest of the mask is in fact gold.<endline><endline>Nehruvian DOOM mask (Oktober 2014)Started to appear around the time DOOM formed the duo NehruvianDoom with Bishop Nehru.<endline><endline>While wearing the golden mask on the NehruvianDoom album artwork, DOOM has been seen sporting a transparent red mask around Bishop Nehru. the same color difference, just like on the gold one, between the spikes and the rest of the mask is also featured on this iteration.
