state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily. And that's fine; we don't have to be enemies and we don't have to be friends either. My family and I are prepared, immediately, to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state, never to return to this state again. We don't have to be here. We're not pining to be here, and we\u2019re complying in every possible way, reasonably. Just today, state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family, and they had no right to do so. I have legal representation here who they could easily contact. They're contravening and breaking all types of international law, and it's untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on. And I know it's been a lot of chatter about what's going on, you know, people are running to the press, because that's just\u2026you know, a money making machine. So, it\u2019s another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera, some tele-novella, and I have no interest in it. Furthermore, related but not directly related to this: I'm retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today, and also from Hollywood, effective immediately. I am releasing my final album this year. Um\u2026and that's that<endline><endline>Peace to all, fear of none. Thank everyone for their time. Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite, as Nas said. And I'm on the side of the right, so people could wish however they want, but I ain't nobody's\u2026I ain't no threat or a hazard to nobody. I really try to mind my business. What people think about me is none of my business, and I'm not here to change people's opinions about me. You don't have to like me; you don't have to like everything that I say. The fact is, is that I have hurt no one. I have injured no parties, and all I require, as is my lawful right, is innocent passage to my domicile. That is all<endline><endline>In summary, I will say this, I will close with a simple prayer: To the one who has created the all, you know me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than people know me. So, forgive me for whatever they know or do not know. Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said. Ameen, ameen, allahumma ameen<endline><endline>And I'll close for you, Ye, with the, with the verse that I kicked for you on December 31st, when you was in Atlantic City and you announced that you and Kim were having Nori. And, and, shout out to Madlib, and Otis, and\u2026and\u2026and Michael and his entire family, and to Mama Jackson and to the whole Jackson clan in L.A., I wish you and your family the best, your mother, you know, reach out to me, Egon, you know, y'all know how to reach.

I do not have to sit idly by and just be persecuted unfairly by a state. They waste enough of my time and... I'm through with you Felicia... we're through. I don't want nothing from you. You can keep the records, the sweatshirts, everything; it's no problem.

He was unarmed and shot at 41 times! No unarmed man should be shot at even once! One of the police officers involved in the Diallo shooting was involved in the killing of Patrick Bailey no more than a year and a half ago! Tyesha Miller was shot in her car in Los Angeles while she had a seizure! I could go on and on with the names of black people who have been killed at the hands of police just this year. But the list is so long that it would turn this letter into a statistic sheet.<endline><endline>Most of the people that got killed by police this year and in the past have probably been some of your fans; fans of some of your favorite artists. They are black people who love us, who defend us, who protect us, who put us in our comfortable homes an dour luxury sports utility vehicles and our well kept hotels suites and our oversized tour buses. They're the people that buy our records, our t-shirts, our concert tickets, and so on, and so forth. They're the same people that are getting murdered, harassed, maimed, and beaten in streets all over the world everyday!<endline><endline>The only people in our community who have not responded to this incident are us. Hip-Hop made one hundred billion dollars last year!... A lot of those dollars came from the 'Comptoms', the 'Brooklyns', the 'Crown Heights', the 'Chicagos', the Detroit ghettos, the St. Louis ghettos... the same ghettos where police run around literally hunting black folks to murder... then cruise the streets shortly thereafter with impunity and arrogance.<endline><endline>We are the Senators and the Congressmen of our communities. We come from communities that don't have nobody to speak for them. That's why they love us. Because we talk about what nobody else will talk about. We represent them. And they need to know that we really represent them. Not when it's just a romantic notion or a paycheck attached to it. When something happens to them it matters to us, because when something happens to them it's happening to us. Because Amadou Diallo is your brother, your cousin, your man... Tyesha Miller is your sister, your aunt, your girl, your wife, your daughter... All of these people are you! You are no different! And just because we're at the top of the Billboard charts, seen on MTV daily, livin' comfortably doesn't mean that we can't get shot, we can't be harassed, we can't be maimed and mistreated.<endline><endline>I hope this is as important to you as it is to me cause when I pass by the projects and when I pass by the hood I don't see nobody but me. I see everybody who looks like me. I see me many years ago as I'm sure many of you do. So it's time for us to come together from the 'jiggy' to the 'hardcore'; from the 'backpacker' to the man with the Lexus and really unite and show the world that we got strength. Show the world who we are. Represent who we are. Who we really are and where we really come from. Let's show people where our heart is... that we haven't forgotten.<endline><endline>Now I'm askin' you and anybody who looks on this letter to come forward and show your heart, to show your love, to love the people who love you back by speaking out against the injustices that they suffer. Because believe me, if the clock was turned backwards we'd be those same people.<endline><endline>Please stay mindful of this. Please be considerate of this letter. Pass it around! Talk about this! Think about it! Keep it on your mind because if you don't... it's going to keep its mind on you.<endline><endline>I wanna thank everybody for taking time out to read this letter. I hope I didn't take up too much of your time. All of the contact information and other information you need to know is enclosed.<endline><endline>I want to wish everybody, each and everyone of ya'll peace, prosperity and love.<endline><endline>Peace,<endline>Mos Def", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/66d90efb0e8b4240aae30047ecbc672b.300x319x1.jpg"}, {"title": "Auditorium", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "The way I feel, sometimes it's too hard to sit still<endline>Things are so passionate, times are so real<endline>Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke<endline>Smile on my face but it's really no joke<endline>You feel it in the street, the people breathe without hope<endline>They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down the focus<endline>The focus get cleared then the light turn sharp<endline>And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary<endline>I speak it so clearly sometimes y'all don't hear me<endline>I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me<endline>I feel it in my bones, black I'm so wide awake<endline>That I hardly ever sleep, my flow forever deep<endline>And it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on a beat<endline>My presence speak volumes before I say a word<endline>I'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement and curb<endline>Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell<endline>Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well<endline>Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across<endline>Mind is a vital force, high level right across<endline>Soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren<endline>I swing round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant<endline>Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided<endline>The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'<endline>Suckas trying to hide like the struggle won't find 'em<endline>Then the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him<endline>Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb<endline>Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell<endline>Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well<endline><endline>", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b13acc0fe75405f9fde88d9e60c03a7a.640x640x1.jpg"}, {"title": "Auditorium w/ the Ruler", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Yo<endline>The way I feel sometimes it's too hard to sit still<endline>Things are so passionate, times are so real<endline>Sometimes I try an chill mellow down blowin' smoke<endline>Smile on my face but it's really no joke<endline><endline>You feel it in the streets, the people breathe without hope<endline>They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down, they focus<endline>The focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp<endline>And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary<endline><endline>I speak it so clearly, sometimes ya don't hear me<endline>I push it past the bass, no nations gotta feel me<endline>I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake<endline>That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep<endline>And it's volumes or scriptures when I breath on a beat<endline><endline>My presence speak volumes before I say a word<endline>I'm everywhere, penthouse, pavement and curb<endline>Cradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell<endline>Universal ghetto life holla black, you know it well<endline><endline>Quiet storm, vital form pen pushed it right across<endline>Mind is a vital force, high level right across<endline>Shoulders the lions raw voice is the siren<endline>I swing round, ring out and bring down the tyrant<endline><endline>Shocked, a small act could knock a giant lopsided<endline>The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'<endline>Suttins tryna hide like the struggle won't find 'em<endline>And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him<endline><endline>Everywhere, penthouse, pavement and curb<endline>Cradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell<endline>Universal ghetto life holla black, you know it well<endline><endline>What it is?
